# Duplicate Finder

A little script to find duplicate files.

It works by generating and comparing hashes from files.

When you run it will ask in which subdirectory do you wish to test for duplicate files.
Then it generates an duplicates.log file in the current directory listing the duplicates found in the sub directory tree.
